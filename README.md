# Android_Me

Working Through the Creation of the "Android_Me" app:

This repository stores my code for the Advanced Android Udacity Lesson about Fragments, which creates an app that modifies a UI to display a custom "Android" figure that has choosable presets for "upper body", "middle body", and "lower body".  The user can specify different selections for each of these body parts and immediately see an updated figure.  This project creates the app by creating 4 different fragments and then piecing them together to create the completed UI.

The four fragments are:

1) Upper Body Image
2) Middle Body Image
3) Lower Body Image
4) Gridview for selecting preset body parts.

To see a fuller description of this lesson, view the README.md from the First Commit.

This commit contains complete "starter code", which included using "DownGit" at https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/ in order to batch download files from GitHub in order to correctly populate "Drawable" folder.
